Hugo is a pretty good static site generator that takes human readable text files and turns them into a beautiful website. Because Hugo sites are statically generated they:

* load quickly,
* do not require patching or plugins,
* have virtually no downtime,
* can be hosted **for free**

For sites that are edited by a few people, many companies are switching to static site generators, like Hugo.

Updating content on Hugo is _slightly_ more technical than updating WordPress content, but does not require any coding. It is a skill that can be easily learned. All edits are recorded in a version control system called git and can be easily undone if something goes wrong.
