Shopify is a Toronto based sales platform. It takes care of:

* the web store front/shopping cart,
* payment processing,
* inventory management,
* shipping postage payments/labels.

It is straightforward to keep up-to-date by non-technical users and can interact with existing inventory management systems. Most importantly it is focused on securely processing payments. GTAI assume no liability for losing or leaking customers' identity or payment information.

The shopify storefront is hosted by shopify on a different site than the core GTAI site. They are responsible for making sure it stays up and secure.
