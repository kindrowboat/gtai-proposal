## Credits

I acknowledge the land I live and work on is the traditional territory of many nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee and the Wendat peoples and is now home to many diverse First Nations, Inuit and MÃ©tis peoples. Toronto is covered by Treaty 13 with the Mississaugas of the Credit.
